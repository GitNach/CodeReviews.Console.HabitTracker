# ConsoleHabitTracker
C# Console Application to Log Habits.
Console based CRUD application to log Habits.
Developed using C# and SQLite.


# Given Requirements:
- [x] This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
- [x] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- [x] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- [x] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- [x] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [x] The app should show the user a menu of options. 
- [x] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [x] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [x] The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- [x] You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
- [x] Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works. Here's a nice example: 

# Features

* SQLite database connection

	- The program uses a SQLite db connection to store and read information. 
	- If no database exists, or the correct table does not exist they will be created on program start.

* A console based UI where users can navigate by key presses

# Challenges
	
- [x] Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.
- [x] Seed Data into the database automatically when the database gets created for the first time, generating a few habits and inserting a hundred records with randomly generated values. This is specially helpful during development so you don't have to reinsert data every time you create the database.
- [x] Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
	
# Areas to Improve
 - Need to move back to main menu
 - Still need to refactor the code to catch exceptions
 - Using Async to interact with database
